## MOEA/D: Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition
-This is a python implementation of MOEA/D [1] with tchebycheff decomposition function, "MOEAD.py".
-As in the original paper, was used Simulated Binary Crossover and Polynomial Mutation, "GeneticOperators.py".
-It was tested on ZDT 1-4 [2], "BenchmarkFunctions.py".

-Obs: For now, just tested for 2 objectives functions. :)

## Experiments Results
-H =299
-Generations: 2000
